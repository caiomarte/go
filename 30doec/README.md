# 30 Days of (Explained) Code

### Hello, refactored chimps!

This is a series of `[30]Post` destined to new Gophers and sympathizers.

In this series, we are going to explore fundamental Go concepts while solving basic algorithm problems. By the end, you should have a general view of Go and be able to understand and write some Go code on your own.

If you’re looking for a problem-based approach for beginners, this is the place for you!

### And how is it going to work?

We are going to solve 30 problems ranging from easy to medium level, one problem each post. These problems belong to [HackerRank’s Tutorial “30 Days of Code”](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code), and they provide the basis we need to start exploring Go.

Each post will follow the same structure:

* **What is the problem?** - A short explanation of what’s required to complete the challenge. It will describe what the problem is and what input and output we should expect.

* **What do we need to know about Go?** - What are the Go concepts we need to know in order to solve the problem? This is our opportunity to discuss and learn the Go basics.

* **Step-by-step coding explained** - Now that we have the theory, it’s time to code. As we solve the problem, I’ll explain each line or block of code based on the concepts we saw previously. In this section, I will prioritize flow of thinking over flow of compilation. That means code may appear in different order in the explanation versus the algorithm. But don’t worry: I’ll place a number before each line indicating its position in the final structure.

* **Key Takeaways** - A summary of what’s been seen for you to save for later.

* **Full commented solution** - The full solution with all necessary comments for you to review.

Please, let me hear from you. Your feedback is essential.
